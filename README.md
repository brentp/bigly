`bigly` is an API and a command-line app ([binaries here](https://github.com/brentp/bigly/releases)). It is similar to `samtools mpileup` but it reports a *huuuge* number of
additional variables that are useful for structural variant calling and visualization.

For each requested position, the struct below is filled by the appropriate position in any overlapping
alignment that meets the requested filters:

```Go
// Pile holds the information about a single base.
type Pile struct {
	Chrom                  string
	Pos                    int
	Depth                  int    // count of reads passing filters.
	RefBase                byte   // Reference base a this position.
	MisMatches             uint32 // number of mismatches .
	ProperPairs            int    // count of reads with paired flag
	SoftStarts             uint32 // counts of base preceding an 'S' cigar op
	SoftEnds               uint32 // ...  following ...
	HardStarts             uint32 // counts of base preceding an 'H' cigar op
	HardEnds               uint32
	InsertionStarts        uint32 // counts of base preceding an 'I' cigar op
	InsertionEnds          uint32
	Deletions              uint32  // counts of deletions 'D' at this base
	Heads                  uint32  // counts of starts of reads at this base
	Tails                  uint32  // counts of ends of reads at this base
	Splitters              uint32  // count of non-secondary reads with SA tags.
	Splitters1             uint32  // count of non-secondary reads with exactly 1 SA tag.
	Bases                  []byte  // All bases from reads covering this position
	Quals                  []uint8 // All quals from reads covering this position
	MeanInsertSizeLP       uint32  // Calculated with left-most of pair
	MeanInsertSizeRM       uint32  // Calculated with right-most of pair
	CountPlusPlus          uint32  // Paired reads mapped in +/+ orientation
	CountMinusMinus        uint32  // Paired reads mapped in -/- orientation
	CountMinusPlus         uint32  // Paired reads mapped in -/+ orientation
	Discordant             uint32  // Number of reads with insert size > ConcordantCutoff
	DiscordantChrom        uint32  // Number of reads mapping on different chroms
	DiscordantChromEntropy float32 // high value means all discordants came from same chrom.
	GC65                   uint32
	GC257                  uint32
	Duplicity65            float32 // measure of lack of sequence entropy.
	Duplicity257           float32 // measure of lack of sequence entropy.
	SplitterPositions      []int
	SplitterStrings        []string
}
```

The program in `cmd/bigly/main.go` is distributed as an example program of what one can do with this
library--namely make an enhanced pileup in a few lines of code.

Usage
-----

At this time, the usage of the example program is very simple.
Default exclude flags are `(sam.Unmapped | sam.QCFail | sam.Duplicate)`

```
bigly $bam $chrom:$start-$end > o
```

if a reference is specified with `-r` it will report statistics about GC content in windows
surrounding each base.

API

GoDoc Documentation is here: [![GoDoc] (https://godoc.org/github.com/brentp/bigly?status.png)](https://godoc.org/github.com/brentp/bigly)

With a supporting library easing regional bam queries here: [![GoDoc] (https://godoc.org/github.com/brentp/bigly/bamat?status.png)](https://godoc.org/github.com/brentp/bigly/bamat)

View the tests for more examples. `bigly` uses [biogo](https://github.com/biogo/hts) library for bam access.

Plotting
--------

```
python scripts/plotter.py bigly.output
```

will make a plot with python+matplotlib on output from bigly.

An example image looks like: 
![Example](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1739/20151721/7a23b46a-a678-11e6-87be-0d4666faffdd.png "Bigly Deletion")

This is a homozygous deletion easily seen from the depth, but we can see that the deletion is nicely
delineated by soft-clips and we see aberrant insert sizes bounding the deletion.
In most libraries, we would also see splitters flanking the region.


TODO
----

+ Track strand of bases.
+ Report the 5th and 95th percentile of insert size.
+ More efficient insert-size calc

Ryan Layer's [svv](https://github.com/ryanlayer/svv) was the inspiration for the plotter.

Obviously, [samtools](https://github.com/samtools/samtools) is the reference pileup implementation.
